# Create Pico App
A minimal react-router app creator for my projects.

## It includes:
- React Router (SSR is disabled by default, you can enable it in `react-router.config.ts`
- ShadCN pre-configured with "neutral" color setting
- TailwindCSS v4
And that's it. I really wanted this to be minimal for creating projects fast and not having to manually installing tailwind or other stuff, but i didn't really added much more.
It runs with typescript by default (you can still obviusly use regular javascript)

I don't know what else to put here lmao
